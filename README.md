# California Housing Affordability Optimization Project

## **Overview**
This project explores housing affordability in California by combining **predictive modeling** and **optimization techniques**. The goal is to identify actionable solutions to address housing affordability challenges using real-world data and advanced analytical methods.

This work is part of the IEOR 240 Optimization Course at UC Berkeley and highlights the application of optimization in housing-related decision-making.

## **Motivation**
California faces a critical housing affordability crisis, with housing costs outpacing income growth. This project aims to:
- Forecast housing costs using historical data.
- Develop an optimization framework to prioritize housing affordability solutions.
- Provide insights to policymakers and individuals navigating California’s housing landscape.

---

## **Objectives**
1. Build predictive models for housing affordability using advanced regression and ensemble methods.
2. Formulate optimization models to:
   - Minimize rent-to-income ratios.
   - Maximize affordable housing placements under budget constraints.
   - Optimize housing policy interventions.
3. Compare traditional optimization methods (e.g., Linear Programming) with heuristic approaches (e.g., Genetic Algorithms).

## **Key Features**
- **Data-Driven Insights:** Uses historical housing market data (2014–2024) from Zillow, U.S. Census Bureau, and other authoritative sources.
- **Predictive Models:** Includes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and regression models to identify key factors affecting affordability.
- **Optimization Models:**
  - Resource allocation for affordable housing improvements.
  - Optimal site selection for new developments based on accessibility and affordability metrics.
  - Policy impact analysis using scenario testing.
